    <p>
      If I were given $1200, and I had to live off of it for a month because of COVID-19 quarentine I would spend it wisely on a couple of different things:  
    </p>  
      <ul>
        <li>3 packs of instant ramen per day for food ($1.26 per day/$37.37 per month)</li>
        <li>Gas (I would dedicate money for 2 tanks of gas for the car i have 77.28 for 1gal, 154.56 for 2 gal)</li>
        <li>Rent (living at home)</li>
        <li>Utilies ($60 - $120)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        This is about what I would dedicate that money too. This would cost from ~$250 to ~$310 per month ($890 left).
