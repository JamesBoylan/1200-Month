        If I were to be quarentined for three months I would dedicate my money pretty much the same.
      </p>  
        <ul>
          <li>3 packs of instant ramen per day for food ($1.26 per day/$37.37 per month)</li>
          <li>Gas (I would dedicate money for 2 tanks of gas for the car i have 77.28 for 1gal, 154.56 for 2 gal)</li>
          <li>Rent (living at home)</li>
          <li>Utilies ($60 - $120)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
          After month 1 I would have ended around $890. If I were to spend my money the same through month two I would've end at $580. And now if my money habits were the same and I were to spend them the same it would be around $270.
