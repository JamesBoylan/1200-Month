          So if this type of thing were to happen again, here are the things I would spend my money on if I had a job. The job that I chose to use as the hypothetical is being a ROBLOX game engine engineer, which pays -from my sources- pays around 100k a year. So every month would pay around 8k per month. So going back to this thought experiment here is what I would spend my money on.
      </p>  
        <ul>
          <li>Food(I would leave around $300-$400 for food)</li>
          <li>Car (I would dedicate $309.12 for gas, and another 200 for other expenses on the car)</li>
          <li>Rent (Apartment ~$4128 per month)</li>
          <li>Utilies ($60 - $120)</li>
          <li>Healthcare($400)</li>
          <li>Entartainment(For games and such: $300)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is the barebones list of things I would buy during a time like this. I would make around 8k a month so taking out the amount I would spend ($5697 - $5757), it would leave me with $2303 which I would put into savings.
